# Plan for Offline-First Implementation

**1. Service Worker for Caching:**
- **Goal:** Make the application load instantly, even without a network connection.
- **Action:** Implement a service worker to cache the main application shell (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and static assets like fonts and images. We'll use a "cache-first" strategy, so the app always loads from the local cache.

**2. Data Caching and Synchronization:**
- **Goal:** Allow users to view and interact with their data while offline.
- **Action:**
    - Use **IndexedDB** (a browser-based database) to store user data locally.
    - When the application is online, it will synchronize the local data with the server.
    - We will implement a basic "last-write-wins" conflict resolution strategy to handle cases where data is changed in multiple places.

**3. Offline User Experience (UX):**
- **Goal:** Clearly communicate the application's online/offline status to the user.
- **Action:**
    - Display a visual indicator (like a banner or toast notification) when the user is offline.
    - Disable any UI elements that require an internet connection.
    - Queue any actions a user takes while offline (like creating or updating data) and process them once the connection is restored.

**4. Background Sync:**
- **Goal:** Reliably send data to the server, even if the user closes the app.
- **Action:** Use the **Background Sync API** to defer network requests until the device has a stable internet connection. This is great for non-critical data like analytics or logging.
